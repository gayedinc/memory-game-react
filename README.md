## Project Overview

The **Memory Game** project is a fun and interactive card-matching game where users must find and match identical card pairs.  
This version is built with React to offer a more modular, performant, and user-friendly experience.

## Core Features

### Card Shuffling & Dynamic Rendering
- At the start of the game, all cards are shuffled using a `shuffle()` function.
- Each card is duplicated to create pairs.
- A new randomized card layout is generated with every new game.

### Selection & Match Checking
- Selected cards are stored in the `selectedCards` state.
- Matched pairs are stored in `matchedCards`.
- When two cards are selected, a match check is triggered, and the cards visually flip open or closed accordingly.

### Time & Move Tracking
- A **timer** starts automatically when the game begins.
- Elapsed time is formatted as (MM: SS) and shown to the player.
- Every two-card selection counts as one **move**, which is also tracked in real-time.

### Game Over & Modal Control
- When all card pairs are matched, the game ends automatically, and a “Game Over” message appears.
- On mobile, a modal with 3 action options appears:
  - **Restart:** Resets the game.
  - **New Game:** Starts a new game with reshuffled cards.
  - **Resume Game:** Closes the modal and continues the current game.

### Confetti Celebration Animation
- When all cards are matched, a **confetti celebration** animates across the screen!
- Implemented using the `react-confetti` package.
- The animation continues until the user clicks **Restart** or **New Game**.

### Responsive & Mobile-Friendly Design
- Fully responsive design to ensure a smooth experience across all devices.
- Optimized for both mobile and desktop usage.

### Modal Dismissal on Outside Click
- Modals automatically close when users click outside their bounds.
- This feature improves UX and is handled using `useRef` and the `mousedown` event listener.

## Development Goals

- Provide visual feedback to reflect user progress and success  
- Track time and move counts to help users monitor performance  
- Ensure full responsiveness across screen sizes and devices  
- Celebrate user success with visual animations and interactions  

## Technologies Used

- React  
- JavaScript (ES6+)  
- CSS3
